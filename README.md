Some Enhancement Ideas for the app:

- Notify Admin for approval by a new registered user

- Searching mechanism on lists while ordering

- Speeding up the application (using some approach or algorithms/mechanism)

- Schedule ordering for a user for each day.

- Implementing Django Rest APIs

- Overall UX designing of the app.

- Integrating UI (i.e. Angular/React JS) with the backend.

- Adding `Remember Me` functionality at login. [So the user doesn't have to login everytime on his same browser]
